# Nuclear-Measurement-Lab---Compton-Effect-2018
Scripts and documents from Nuclear Measurements Lab course at University of Studies of Milan (2018)

Inside this folder you can find all data, measurements, documents and scripts used to evaluate the Klein-Nishina cross section law of the Compton effect.

Here a brief summary:
The experience descripted consists in an experimental verification of the Compton effect using Sodium22 decaying beta+.
Taking advantage from the back to back photon pair production, the Klein-Nishina law, relating the scattered photon's energy to the diffusion angle, was verified
and the differential cross section has been measured for different angles. In the first phase of the experiment the optimal experimental conditions were 
determined, while in the second phase the real measurements were taken and spectra were analyzed to remove backgrounds and get the optimal data. With this data, 
as said, it has been possible to measure the Klein-Nishina law as well as getting a pretty accurate estimation of the radius/mass ratio of the electron (as 
classicaly described).

This experience has been completed by myself, S. Zanoli and E. Radaelli under the supervision of Professor E. Meroni.
